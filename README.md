# Learn Go Notes

Welcome to my personal repository for learning the **Go programming language (Golang)**.  
This space is dedicated to documenting what I'm learning and practicing as I go through resources like:

- [W3Schools Go Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/go/)
- [The Official Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/)

## 📚 What's Inside

This repo includes:

- 📒 Notes and summaries from tutorials
- 🧪 Practice code snippets
- 🛠️ Mini-projects and exercises
- 💡 Key takeaways and gotchas

## 🛤️ Learning Path

I'll be following a mix of hands-on practice and reading through concepts in this order:

1. Basics (syntax, variables, types)
2. Control structures
3. Functions and packages
4. Arrays, slices, and maps
5. Structs and interfaces
6. Concurrency (goroutines, channels)
7. Error handling
8. File I/O
9. Modules and packages
10. Small projects

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- To reinforce learning through writing and practice
- To have a reference I can come back to
- To share knowledge with anyone on a similar journey

Feel free to fork, clone, or follow along!

**Happy coding, Gophers! 🐹**
